# Quick notes on individual projects
## sans-car
Overall, Sans Car was a really fun (and stupid) way of teaching myself how to code at a self-sustainable level.
Put simply, Sans Car responds to every discord message that contains 'sans car' and respond with a meme.
The project grew over time and then I started learning how to implement APIs and host websites to give the project some love.

Things I've learned: 
1. Bot
    * basic frameworks for running websocket based NodeJS applications.
    * how to use higher order functions to create cleaner code.
    * how to create a simple way to extend the program's functionality through dynamic imports.
2. Website
    * basics of SSL encryption and self-hosting.
    * basics of HTML/CSS/JS and JS Frameworks (React)
    * fulfilling APIs
